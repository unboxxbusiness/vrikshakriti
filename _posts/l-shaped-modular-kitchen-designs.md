# 5 L-Shaped Modular Kitchen Designs for Small Spaces

The L-shaped kitchen is a classic for a reason. It's efficient, versatile, and works wonders in small spaces.

## 1. The Classic Corner

Utilize a corner to its fullest by placing your main workstations along two adjacent walls. This creates an efficient work triangle.

## 2. The Peninsula Add-on

Add a peninsula to your L-shape to create extra counter space and a casual dining spot.

## 3. Open-Concept Flow

Integrate your L-shaped kitchen with your living area for a seamless, open feel.

## 4. Window as a Focal Point

Design your layout around a window to bring in natural light and create a beautiful view while you cook.

## 5. Smart Storage Solutions

Incorporate pull-out cabinets, corner carousels, and vertical storage to make the most of every inch.
