# The Ultimate Guide to Modular Kitchen Accessories

A Vrikshakriti luxury kitchen is more than just beautiful cabinets and countertops; it's a symphony of design and functionality. The right accessories are key to unlocking the full potential of your space, making it a joy to cook and live in.

## 1. Tall Units

A tall unit or pantry is a game-changer for storage. It utilizes vertical space to store everything from groceries to small appliances, keeping your countertops clutter-free.

## 2. Corner Solutions

Don't let corner space go to waste. A 'LeMans' corner unit or a 'Magic Corner' pulls out to give you easy access to pots, pans, and other bulky items that are otherwise hard to reach.

## 3. Cutlery Organizers

Bring order to your drawers with dedicated cutlery trays. These simple inserts keep your spoons, forks, and knives neatly organized and easy to find.

## 4. Under-Sink Units

The area under the sink is often underutilized. A specialized U-shaped drawer or a pull-out unit can provide a clever spot for cleaning supplies.

## 5. Pull-Out Baskets

Instead of deep cabinets where items get lost at the back, opt for pull-out wire baskets. They bring everything into view, making it easy to grab what you need.

By incorporating these smart accessories, your Vrikshakriti kitchen becomes a testament to luxury and efficiency. Ready to design your dream kitchen? **Get a free quote today!**
