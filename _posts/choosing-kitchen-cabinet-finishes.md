# Matte vs. Glossy: Which Cabinet Finish is Right for You?

The finish of your cabinets has a huge impact on the overall look of your kitchen.

## Matte Finishes

- **Look:** Sophisticated, modern, and hides fingerprints well.
- **Feel:** Smooth and velvety to the touch.
- **Best for:** Contemporary and minimalist kitchens.

## Glossy Finishes

- **Look:** Sleek, light-reflecting, and makes spaces feel larger.
- **Feel:** Smooth and shiny.
- **Best for:** Small kitchens and those going for a high-glam look.

## The Verdict

The choice depends on your personal style and the amount of natural light in your kitchen. Both can look stunning when done right.
