# A Complete Guide to Perfect Kitchen Lighting

Good lighting is crucial in a kitchen. Here's how to get it right.

Focused light for specific tasks. Think under-cabinet lighting for countertops.

## 3. Accent Lighting

Used to highlight architectural features or decor. Pendant lights over an island are a great example.
