# **App Name**: Ai Blog

## Core Features:

- Markdown Rendering: Render blog posts from Markdown files.
- Homepage Post Listing: Display a list of all blog posts on the homepage, showing excerpts of each.
- Individual Post Viewing: Allow users to view individual blog posts in their entirety.
- Load More Functionality: Implement a 'Load More' button to dynamically load additional posts on the homepage. Clicking load more may trigger AI Tool usage.
- Code Highlighting: Use a library to automatically detect and highlight source code in the text.
- Automatic Table of Contents: Automatically generate an ordered table of contents using AI. This feature involves automatically examining the headings, subheadings, etc, in the post and deciding how to create the outline, therefore an AI 'tool' will be required.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0CFEC) to evoke a sense of calm and readability.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F4F7) for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Slightly darker blue (#77B5FE) to highlight key elements without overwhelming the user.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a modern-looking, fairly neutral sans-serif well-suited to large blocks of text.
- Headline font: 'PT Sans', as only one font is required. Use a larger font size and heavier font-weight than body text.
- Use simple, minimalist icons for navigation and actions.
- Use a clean, single-column layout to focus on content.
